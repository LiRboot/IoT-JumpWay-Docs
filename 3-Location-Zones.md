 In the previous tutorial you learnt how to create your first Location Space which represents a physical location such as a home or office. Now we will take you through the short process of assigning Zones to the Location Space you just created.

 A Zone represents a zone within your Location Space. For example if your Location Space represented your home, you could make your first Location Zone your living room, dining room , kitchen or garden.

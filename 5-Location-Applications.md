 In the previous tutorial you learnt how to create your first Location Device. Now we will take you through the short process of setting up Application credentials that will allow you to manage your IoT Locations/Zones & Devices.

 An Application has the capabilities of subscribing to all devices attached to that specific Location Space. You can use Location Applications to manage and monitor your devices.

## Location Applications Guide

- In the left hand menu on the [TechBubble Technologies IoT JumpWay Developer Program (BETA) GUI](https://iot.techbubbletechnologies.com/developers/ "TechBubble Technologies IoT JumpWay Developer Program (BETA) GUI"), click on the "Location Applications" button to toggle the drop down navigation, then click on the "Create Application" button.

- Once you have landed on the "Create Applications" page, things should be fairly straight forward from here. Follow the instructions on the page, select your Location Space that you wish to assign the Application to, add a name for the Application and click on the "Create Location Application" button.

- You will be provided with API Keys and MQTT Credentials, you should make a note of these and keep them safe as you will need them for communicating with the IoT JumpWay.
